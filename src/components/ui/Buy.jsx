        1. Set up a crypto wallet with access to the Base network. Coinbase
        Wallet is recommended. If you are using another wallet such as MetaMask,
        follow these steps to connect to Base.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Send Ethereum (ETH) to your wallet on the Base network, or send to
        your wallet via the Ethereum network then bridge to Base using Coinbase
        Walletâ€™s in-wallet bridge, Orbiter or Synapse.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. Head to LlamaSwap with this link that has an ETH to $BENSON swap
        preloaded. LlamaSwap is an aggregator that swaps via multiple sites at
        once, giving you the best price. Make sure your wallet is connected on
        the Base network.
        <br />
        <br />
        $BENSON contract address:
        <br />
        <br />
        4. Select how much you want to swap for $BENSON, click Swap and confirm
        the transaction in your wallet.
